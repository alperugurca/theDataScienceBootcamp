    "# Job Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple job recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Loads job data from a CSV file, combines relevant columns, and uses TF-IDF vectorization to create a numerical representation of the job descriptions. The get_recommendations function takes a job title as input, calculates its similarity to all jobs in the dataset, and returns the top 5 most similar jobs along with their key skills and salaries.\n",
