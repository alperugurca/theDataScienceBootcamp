       " 'after my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, i got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  i thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  i think that is admirable.  i did not take them up on the offer, because i don\\'t feel that would be appropriate - i\\'m interested in doing yelp reviews because i have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and i want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - i\\'m not looking for freebies.so, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to lgo and see what\\'s shakin.  i grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  the evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  it\\'s always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  we went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  i nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  after placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, i moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with stella.  did i mention that this is an awesome deal?  so, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  my wife\\'s fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh\\'s and ahhhhs\\', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  she also raved about the slaw that came with it.  i think she liked this sandwich.  the burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  i ordered it medium rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - i\\'m aware.  really. and i asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  it came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  it had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  with a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  the portion was impressive.  that\\'s about where it ended for me.  the burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  it\\'s impressive, i\\'ll give \\'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn\\'t work for me.  the cheese needs to be melted.  a good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  lot\\'s of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  i scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if i had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  flavor was so-so.  after i added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  the veggies were fresh and crispy.  a side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  i like my fries belgian style.  the bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that i could not eat it still.  overall, i stand by my original review of the burgers here.  i realize lgo is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and i applaud the effort, but i think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  the fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  the ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm friday night.  lgo - keep working on the burger, i\\'ll keep coming in, but i think i\\'ll stick with the wings for now.',\n",

       " 'in our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, caroline and i auditioned vintage  last night. before i go further, understand that whenever i go out for eats or drinks, i have  in  mind a platonic ideal of the bar/pub/eatery i most want to frequent. i\\'m on a constant quest to find that  ideal expressed in real life. vintage  isn\\'t quite there, but it\\'s damn close. if i ever give something five stars, you\\'ll know it has pegged my platonic ideal. anyway...the plan last night was for drinks. no plans for food, just adult beverages and warm conversation. but it turned into more.the location in downtown chandler is terrific for us. the owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. and they don\\'t have the music turned up so loud that you cannot have a conversation. this is one of my pet peeves. if i want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, i\\'ll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. when i go out with friends, i want to enjoy their company and their conversation. is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]the atmosphere at vintage  is very close to my ideal. i\\'d go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. seriously - go check out the patio. it is exactly what a patio hangout bar should be. exactly.caroline and i told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. it wasn\\'t initmate, but we weren\\'t looking for intimate. and speaking of the bar, even though v advertises itself as a wine bar, they do have booze. i\\'m not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal glenfiddich /glenlivit /glenmorangie trio to which most places are limited. i had a couple of drums of ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but i was celebrating so i didn\\'t care.) caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder i love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. the limited happy hour menu had some very interesting choices. we settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. the bruschetta was very nice and quite unusual. you get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: () white bean and pancetta, () gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, () fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, () brie, pear and onion jam. they were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but i really liked it. the tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. caroline said it was unique and i say it was just darn delicious. things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. a friend had told us \"you have to try the vintage burger\", so we did. it came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. recommended. the burger was very tasty. they obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin\\'s were tasty. highly recommended.in for a dime, in for a dollar, right? so we ordered dessert. again, the dessert menu is short, but i\\'m okay with that as long as they do it well. chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn\\'t remember. i\\'m allergic to hazelnut and don\\'t like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn\\'t find it anywhere else. it was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. it was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. i didn\\'t realize it was hazelnut until i\\'d had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.at this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn\\'t. we told the waiter who told the manager, (gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if i needed emergency assistance. i didn\\'t, i\\'m not that allergic.)  frankly, their response was exactly the kind of customer service you want to see. anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. but i must give big kudos to gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.we will defintely be back and i strongly recommend you put it on your list too.',\n",

       " 'came here for lunch recently with active yelper and friend brett b. i\\'m sure he\\'ll post up his own review of the place.this is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. you also get your glass and go fill \\'er up at the fountain yourself. i wasn\\'t sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute i asked \"how big is the salad\" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. that was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a \"size\" with their hands and shrug and say, \"i don\\'t know... about like this?\" so, yeah. i like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a \"mound\" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. when i ordered \"just water\" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, \"you know what? just take a regular glass, it\\'s more comfortable....\" he trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and i did only drink water). that was nice, and made me feel like an adult. not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor\\'s office, when you order water.i really enjoyed my lunch here - had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because i\\'ll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.the caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was \"perfect\" . the portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. the chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes such a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. it was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. and the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. nice touch. excellent flavor, every mouthful.the cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, i\\'m spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from totonno\\'s in nyc\\'s upper east side. but still, darn good. i\\'d eat it again. (i took some home and it didn\\'t look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. i think it had pine nuts too. i got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. delicious. and the service was great! the  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. great food - great service - great vibe. i hope this place sticks around. definitely would eat there again. looking forward to it, even!',\n",

       " \"food was good. i had the choppino fruittas de mare. apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a fruits de mare type plate that i've had at other restaurants. sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, i think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. kid's spaghetti was very good. i taste all the kid's spaghetti since i have  kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. the pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which i hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). there isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. bread, of course, was available prior to meals. the butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic i think. bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.now i would have given  stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. decor was dreadful, sorry. old and dated. i think their target demographics is  years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 's. the chairs remind me of an old conference hall. the lighting is on the dark side. i guess if i was out on a date or with  retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with  adults and  kids it just doesn't fit quite right.kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place i usually prefer.\",\n",
